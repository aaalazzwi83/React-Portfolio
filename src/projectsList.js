		caption: "Reel Time is my final graduation project. Utilising a combination of React, Sequelize and Express, and built in a group of 4, this project is a culmination of everything we had learnt on over the previous 6 months. My role in the group was to focus on the back-end, including routing, server setup and database management.",

By utilizing the Mongoose library, the user has the choice to save the book to a Mongo database, and then remove it later if they wish, from the Saved Books page.",

		altText: "FurEver Home",
		caption: "I was lucky enough to work with the same group people as I did during 'Fridge Chef' and we grew even further as an adaptable team. We had the option to build the app in React, which we took upon ourselves to attempt. We are happy with the result but do believe that it requires further editing to reach its full potential. The idea for this app was birthed through a strong passion for helping animals and their adoption, as too many are forgotten in shelters. Please adopt!",

		altText: "Halo Themed Clicky Game",
		caption: "I found this one very enjoyable! Built entirely in React, much like this portfolio, I was introduced to the complexities of working in almost an entirely new language. I'm hoping to make all further projects in React as it's very intuitive, logical and fun to work in!",

		altText: "Friend Finder",
		caption: "This app is very similar to 'Which character are you most like?' quizzes that were popular during the Internet's first boom. I enjoyed making this as I got to utilise my favorite film series again - Lord of the Rings. The math required for this app to work properly was challenging but I'm glad to say I overcame it.",

		caption: "A CLI shopping application much like the famous website with a similar name. Users are able to place orders and deplete stock inventory, all of which is stored on a MYSQL server. The app also uses inquirer (which I LOVE) to guide the user through their experience.",

		caption: "LIRI is much like the iPhone's SIRI, but it uses language interpretation rather than speech! LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies and will work through Node's command line input. This was my first, purely back-end application. It opened my eyes to a wider world of programming.",

		caption: "Project one, what a blast. Myself and three fellow programmers created this website in just two weeks. Working in our amazing group made the whole project an absolute joy. We set off with the desire to incorporate as many of the technologies we had learnt on our first 9 weeks in the bootcamp, and we are all very satisfied with the end result. I predominantly worked on the Ingredient Entry page and had a lot of fun utilising local storage, however we all were happy to help each other when required. This page lets the user select common ingredients from their fridge and the website returns a recipe.",

		caption: "A Lord of the Rings trivia quiz. With dynamically appending questions, countdown timers and a rating screen at the end, this was one of my favorite projects to work on. Not just because of the theme used, but also because this project was the first one with full creative freedom. My favorite piece of feedback from this was: 'Your UI is beautiful' So proud!",

I am quite fond of Firebase and its intricacies and it was extremely exciting to utilize a server for the first time. I designed this page in the colors of my grandfather's favorite style of train, the Southern Railway King Arthur - Sir Lamiel.",

		caption: "This is a gif display website! Simply write in the name of a video game, click your shiny new button and an assortment of related gifs will display. I included an option for an amount of gifs to display for further functionality. This website required the use of APIs and AJAX calls, which were very exciting.",
